00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:19.003
If I had to live my life without you near me

2
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.009
The days would all be empty

3
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.009
The nights would seem so long

4
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.008
With you I see forever oh so clearly

5
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:37.002
I might have been in love before

6
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:41.000
But it never felt this strong

7
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.005
Our dreams are young and we both know

8
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:48.000
They'll take us where we want to go

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.007
Hold me now

10
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.002
Touch me now

11
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't want to live without you

12
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.004
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

13
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:03.003
You ought to know by now how much I love you

14
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.004
One thing you can be sure of

15
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.006
I'll never ask for more than your love

16
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.006
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

17
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:16.005
You ought to know by now how much I love you

18
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.003
The world may change my whole life through

19
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:25.004
but nothing's gonna change my love for you

20
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.009
If the road ahead is not so easy

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.007
Our love will lead the way for us

22
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.001
Like a guiding star

23
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:44.001
I'll be there for you if you should need me

24
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.006
You don't have to change a thing

25
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.003
I love you just the way you are

26
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.008
So come with me and share the view

27
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.001
I'll help you see forever too

28
00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.001
Hold me now

29
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:02.008
Touch me now

30
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:07.005

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.008
You ought to know by now how much I love you

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.008
One thing you can be sure of

34
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:21.002
I'll never ask for more than your love

35
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:24.002
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

36
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.003
You ought to know by now how much I love you

37
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.009
The world may change my whole life through

38
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:34.008
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

39
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

40
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.003
You ought to know by now how much I love you

41
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.002
The world may change my whole life through

42
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:48.006
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

43
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:04.002
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

44
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:08.001
You ought to know by now how much I love you

45
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:11.004
One thing you can be sure of

46
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:14.006
I'll never ask for more than your love

47
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:17.007

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:21.003
You ought to know by now how much I love you

49
00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:24.003
The world may change my whole life through

50
00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:28.003
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

51
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:31.000
Nothing's gonna change my love for you

52
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000

But nothing's gonna change my love for you

55
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.800
"True love is hard to find...when you found it...
Take a good care of it while you still have time"
